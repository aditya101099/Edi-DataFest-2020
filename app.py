analysis_dict = {"5G":"The graph shows a normal-like curve with a peak in early April, when concerns about 5G causing coronavirus were high after a now labelled “fake” video surfaced of people in Wuhan tearing down cell phone towers. The concerns were shot down quickly which is why we see a fall as fast as the rise.", "Automation":"Interest in automation saw a slight decrease in march following lockdowns, however, increased research and interest in automation following the Global Automation and Robotics conference has led to some rare spikes in early May.", "Drones":"Searches for drones have increased since the start of March, with the highest number of searches on 24 April and 27 March, when it was reported drones will be delivering coronavirus supplies and the police were using drones to send messages to people breaking lockdown respectively.","Cloud Computing":"Cloud computing searches saw a gradual increase until the start of May, with a peak at the start of May reflecting conference activity.

This constant volume of searches nonetheless saw two erratic peaks on May 18th and May 22nd following the patenting of Cemtrex's 'SmartDesk' and Sony and Microsoft's partnership on ISVs specialising in computer vision.", "Disruptive Technology":"Interest in disruptive technologies has been sporadic across March to May. Peaks have been consistent around the same level of searches.", "Web 2.0":"Searches for Web 2.0 have seen a progressive decline since the early and mid March peaks, brought about by conference activity and the subsequent release of a seminal paper by HBR on Web 2.0 respectively,  to less than 1/3rd of peak levels.", "Augmented Reality":"Searches for AR and Artificial reality peaked across March 25-29 following a set of promising press releases and Facebook's F8 livestream announcement of a new roll-out of AR features, before falling to pre-lockdown levels.", "Virtual Reality":"Searches for VR have remained sporadic across the March-May period, with a slight decrease in searches from regular 60-65/100 peaks in March to peaks of 52-54/100 in May.

Despite this, search volatility remains high, peaking around new announcements in the industry and during Robotics Conference times.", "Internet of Things":"Internet of things searches saw a decline from an index score of 55/100 to ~43/100 across early to mid-March, with a subsequent uptake of interest reflecting increased startup activity in this subsector.

Since then, the term has once again become more interesting with multiple peaks and an overall increasing trend suggesting greater business interest in this technology. Across this time, the highest peak in search interest came at the end of may, following reports by the ACS stating that Quantum Tech would create more than 16k new jobs.","Blockhain":"Interest in Blockchain searches decreased from early march till March 25th, after which, with the transition to a more digital form of operations and greater interest in adopting new digital technologies, Blockchain searches saw a progressive increase, rising from 48/100 index score to 100/100 with multiple peaks in late April and May following the announcements of Sony's new Blockchain Database, China's BSN and later Telegram’s troubles with the TON platform. Since mid-May, there has been a slight decrease in interest, but searches remain >30% higher than in the immediate pre-COVID-19 period.", "Artificial Intelligence":"Searches for Artificial intelligence decreased as the UK lockdown became imminent suggesting decreased business activity, interest and research in this field. Nonetheless, the decrease has not been too significant, and searches remained at an average of 62/100 index score compared to pre-lockdown highs. Following early may technology conferences there has been a rise in searches and the trend seems to be reverting to pre-COVID cyclical norms where there is considerably higher activity during business days and proportionately lower activity during weekends, suggesting businesses and research units are beginning to function as normal.","Natural Language Processing":"Natural language processing searches have remained largely consistent across the March to mid April period with a small decline between mid April and late may reflect a shift in business priorities and some businesses move away from research investments.","Machine Learning":"Interest in Machine learning fell from pre-lockdown business activity levels to 3/4 of normal. This subsequently rose, and, following multiple technological conferences in early May, searches for Machine Learning have returned to pre-lockdown highs with index scores of 95-97/100.", "how to make a mask":"The search trends have increased with the fll peaks beitores were still low on supply, leading to people enquiring how to make their own.", "emotional intelligence":"The search trends for emotional intelligence have remained fairly consistent and coronavirus seems to have had no effect on this.", "sewing":"The search trends for sewing increased over the sample time period with the first big jump on April 22, the day series 6 of the Great British Sewing Bee premiered and the following next peaks being the days of new episodes.", "learn a language":"Searches for learn a language experienced an increase in early April and have remained relatively constant since.", "painting":"Searches for the painting have increased during the sample time, with a steady increase in searches up until 26 April with an index score of 100l.

This can be attributed to the food shortage the UK was experiencing where most could not get ahold of basics like bread so people switched to making these items themselves.", "ks2 maths":"This search term saw its biggest increase after UK schools shut and many parents were forced to be in charge of their child’s learning. There was a significant decrease over the first two weeks of April, this would have been the Easter holiday for most children, hence there were less searches as parents wanted to stick with the normal school schedule.", "home workout":"The searches follow a normal-like curve with a peak on 24 March and has been slowly decreasing since. This can be attributed to people having to adjust to not using gyms. The fall in searches can be attributed to people finding a home workout they’re comfortable with and so stop searching or routines.", "online courses":"Searches began to increase around 16 March and had a small peak on March 24, searches had a slight drop over two days but picked back up quickly to reach its peak on March 31. Many businesses were closing at this time and workers were being furloughed, uncertain whether their job will be available when they were able to come back. This is why we see an increase in the search term as workers are looking to gain new skills / learn something new.", "working from home":"Searches steadily increased from the start of March, peaking on March 17. This was around the period most companies were shifting their operations to function remotely in anticipation of a nationwide lockdown. This search term had a second peak on March 23, the day the UK lockdown was announced, and began falling from then. The dips in the graphs occur on Sundays, slowly rising until Wednesday and slowly dipping again. This trend has continued on since March 23.

"Microsoft":"Interest in Microsoft searches spiked on the 23rd of March and has shown continued high ay on weekdays smand is still high averaging 78-82 on weekdays on a /100 index (as compared with 48-50 on weekdays pre-COVID).This reflects how many firms have shifted to using Microsoft Teams to communicate in light of the pandemic, more than doubling the user base over this time period.", "Amazon":"Interest in Amazon in the UK has remained very high across all UK regions, with Wales and Scottish demand outpacing English or Northern Irish demand proportionally to population over this time period. Amazon interest has seen a steady increase from approximately 61/100 to 100 on March 29th, with multiple further peaks in April and May. Consistently high demand has slightly subsided from maximum levels, but interest in Amazon still far exceeds pre-Covid levels, with an almost 50% increase in daily searches.

A decrease in interest may reflect how the economy is starting to open up and less people are now surfing social media than durign the pandemic time. An interesting trend is that proportional to population there is considerably higher interest in facebook in NI (100/100) Wales (90/100) and Scotland (80/100) compared to England (64/100) which may reflect the continuation of work in industrial hubs in England and the subsequently lower-than-proportional use of social media.", "Tesla":"Tesla searches saw a major drop  from early march to mid april, and despite the peak across apr 30-may 3, has since been on a downwards trajectory.", "BMW":"BMW searches dropped off with an almost 50% decrease between 6th of March and early march.

The uptake in searches towards the end of August correlates with increasing numbers of retail investors looking to invest at a heavily impacted market and explains the subsequent increase in real estate to nearly equal early March highs.
